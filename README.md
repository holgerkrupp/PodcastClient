# PodcastClient
An Open Source Podcast client.

Creating a new Podcast client with

- no backend for refreshing feeds (for cost & reliability reasons)
- inbox/queue system
- skipping chapters
- different playback speeds per feed
Kapitelbilder
Optional: CarPlay / Android Auto
Playlists/Save-Queue-Function to switch between everyday/special use
- OPML Import/Export
some users really want a good sleep timer. No idea why.
- skip forward/back 15/30s buttons in Player UI
- Shownotes with clickable links
- configurable automatic download  behavior (download all new, only keep last n episodes, no auto-download) per feed

Nice to have:
- skip intro/outro per feed (n seconds)
- Chapter Images
fyyd.de as search engine
- avoid accidentally skipping forward or backwards
